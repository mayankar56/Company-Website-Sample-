The website of Company will be developed and hosted on a Linux server by using the Apache HTTP Server (httpd). The company website in this modern digital world is considered an entry point to access information, and it marks the first contact for anyone interested in finding out details regarding the services, accreditation, and procedures followed for application.
Based on such aspects, I have considered the option of hosting my website on a Linux server using httpd because it is stable, flexible, and very cost-effective. Linux servers are known to be stable, secure, and essentially open source in all software, hence applied majorly in web hosting. Apache's httpd can be referred to as one of the most used web servers having vast documentation and an associated community support; therefore, setting up, changing configuration, and managing my website is not a problem.
 The process in developing the website would entail the design and coding procedure, configuration and deployment of the website on a Linux server, and also how to troubleshoot such sites to ensure optimal functioning. This project will enable us to demonstrate the use of core web development skills, server management, and fundamental website deployment on a Linux environment.
